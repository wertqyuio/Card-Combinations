1. Reading the pbn file to identify available information before scraping it

Notes:
-can change parser to collect more information later
-also note board # is implictly index less 1

2. Link the pbn data to database
  a. Import deals and results to data_upload.py file
  b. Split each deal into distributions

3. Set-up database with primary-key = fit, split, suit, and date (3 inputs)
  a. Need table for distributions and frequency
  b. Need table for each hand

4. Connect to database

5. Insert data into database
  a. Clean data 
  b. Specific data
    i. Add deals data to database
    ii. Add distributions data to database

6. Consider reorganizing data so that product easier to generate
  a. Note that actual card combinations data easy to find
  b. Valuation is IMPORTANT, there are five valuations for every suit (four trump and no trump)
    i. Valuation flips based on orientation (re: board #)

7. Constructed original post mort-em insights.
  a. Reports 5 most common split for all suits.

N. Don't forget virtual environment items.
   Fix primary keys for deals and distributions. ??? not sure if necessary
   Fix data insertion
   Add tests
   Look into pandas
   Get rid of integer arrays
